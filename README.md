# Slinky
Slinky takes advantage of a vulnerability found in most modern web browsers to implement a sly link.

## How it works
A sly link is best explained by demonstrating how it works.
1. A link is clicked on any website that opens your page in a new tab.
2. This page secretly redirects the origional website without the user knowing.
This works on any website that opens links in a new tab using target="_blank"
As you can probably guess, this can be used to create phising attacks.

## Liability
I am not liable for how anyone uses Slinky. I created this simply to demonstrate a vulnerability found in most web browsers.
